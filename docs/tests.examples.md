# Tests Examples

## Table of contents

A typical integration test looks like this:

```typescript
it('should display new todo', async () => {
  // SETUP: render the page you want to test
  const page = renderPage(<TodoList />, initialState);
  // GIVEN: get the DOM elements you want to interact with
  const TodoInput = page.getByPlaceholder(wording.todos.newTodo);
  const AddTodoButton = page.getByText(wording.todos.add);
  // WHEN: simulate user interaction
  fireEvent.changeText(TodoInput, newTodoText);
  fireEvent.press(AddTodoButton);
  // THEN: expect a visual feedback
  const NewTodo = await waitForElement(() => page.queryByText(newTodoText));
  expect(NewTodo).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Now let's see the different cases you might encounter while testing your React Native App

## Setup your tests

To make sure your integration tests are as close as what the user will experience as possible, you need to setup your setup your tests properly.
The setup of your tests should reproduce as much as possible the code run at the top of our app in our `App` component. Indeed, if in your app, you use redux and sagas for example, they should run in your test environment as well.

Here is an example of a basic `App` component:

```jsx
export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <AppContainer />
      <Toaster />
    </Provider>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Besides that, we also have sagas that are fired at the start of the app. Let's see how to set it all up.

### Custom `render` function

To start testing your app, you will first need your own `render` function (I called mine `renderPage`) to render the components you want to test. With integration tests, I personnaly like to test page components only. It's in your `render` function that you will setup Redux, sagas and such.

If you want to dive straight into the code, here is [the file](âˆš) with the renderPage function

#### Redux Provider

If you use Redux, you want your page to have access to the redux store and be capable of dispacthing actions to it in your test environment.

Basically, for each test, we create a new real redux store with an initial state.
This store is passed to the page via a provider wrapping the page in the renderPage method:

```jsx
export const renderPage = (
  page: ReactElement,
  initialState?: Partial<IAppState>,
) => {
  storeManager.store = createInitialiasedStore(initialState);

  const pageContainerComponent = (
    <Provider store={storeManager.store}>
      {page}
    </Provider>
  );

  return render(pageContainerComponent);
```

You can notice the initialisation of a new store through a helper `creatInitialisedStore`. Here it is:

```typescript
export const createInitialiasedStore = (initialState?: Partial<IAppState>) =>
  createStore(rootReducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));
```

Files to check out:

- [this test](../../pages/TodoList/__tests__/TodoList.test.tsx)
- [mockStore](./mockStore.ts)

#### Saga initialization

The sagas are set up in the `renderPage` method and then behave just like they would in the devlopement environment.

```jsx
export const renderPage = (page: ReactElement, initialState?: Partial<IAppState>) => {
  storeManager.store = createInitialiasedStore(initialState);
  sagaMiddleware.run(watchAll);

  const pageContainerComponent = <Provider store={storeManager.store}>{page}</Provider>;

  return render(pageContainerComponent);
};
```

Files to check out:

- [this test](../../pages/Subscription/__tests__/Subscription.test.tsx)
- [renderPage method](./helpers.tsx)
- [mockStore](./mockStore.ts)

#### Root-level components (eg. Toaster)

Let's say that your `App` component looks like this :

```jsx
export const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <AppContainer />
    <Toaster />
  </Provider>
);
```

Then in some tests, you will need to test that your Toaster appears correctly. To do that, just add your Toaster component in your `renderPage` function like so:

```jsx
export const renderPage = (
  page: ReactElement,
  initialState?: Partial<IAppState>,
) => {
  storeManager.store = createInitialiasedStore(initialState);

  const pageContainerComponent = (
    <Provider store={storeManager.store}>
      {page}
      <Toaster/>
    </Provider>
  );

  return render(pageContainerComponent);
```

#### Navigation

### Api Calls

## Find elements in your DOM

- Buttons --> getByText
- Input --> getByPlaceholder
- Loader --> getByTestId

## Simulate user interaction

- Press button
- Write in input
- Scroll
- Any other event

## Expect some (visual) feedback

- Loading
- Navigation
- A component appears (waitForElement)
- A disabled button does not call its onClick

## Other scenarios

- Need fake timers
- Need to rerender page

```

```
