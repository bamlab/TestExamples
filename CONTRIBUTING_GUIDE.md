## DRAFT / IDEAS

- **Report lack of an example / propose an improvement** --> open an issue
- **Add an example but don't have much time** --> open a PR with only the doc added and open an issue for the code to be added (you can edit the doc and open the PR straight from github)
- **Add an example and have a bit of time** --> open a PR with doc and code
